# PauLingo
This is an university project that consists in doing an application to learn languages.
This is the project we had to make for the Humanâ€“computer interaction course. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was not to provide a fully functional application but only doing the GUI part with some very basic menus etc..
We decided to do more than that and provide more or less a functional application.

# The technologies 
We used Java and Netbeans IDE.  <br/> 
We implemented an embedded DB using the Netbeans's JDBC driver and also a working authentification system. As the application launch, the app connects to the DB and the SQL tables are automatically created and therefore the SQL DB is fully operational. <br/>
We used and learn by doing how to do the GUI of a java app by using and JavaFX. Plus we used some CSS to make it more beautiful.<br/> 

# How to use
In Netbeans IDE, create a new Database using the JDBC driver and 'root' as password and as username. <br/>
Once connected, you will land on the authentification form. Use 'sameh' as username and also 'sameh' as password (or use 'remy') to login.
